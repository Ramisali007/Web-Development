Overview
I implemented this project to create an interactive web-based tool that processes a user-inputted string by reversing it while skipping characters at specific intervals. The skip interval is determined by summing the digits of the user's roll number. The transformed result is displayed dynamically on the webpage.

Features
String Transformation: Reverses the string while skipping every N-th character.
Dynamic List: Displays the original and transformed strings in a list.
Skip Interval Calculation: The skip interval is calculated by summing the digits of the roll number.
Responsive Design: The layout adapts to different screen sizes.

How to Use

Enter a string in the "Enter a string" field.

Enter your roll number in the "Enter roll number" field.

Click the "Transform" button to see the result.

The original and transformed strings will be displayed in the results list.

Code Structure
HTML: index.html
CSS: styles.css
JavaScript: scripts.js

Constraints
No external libraries or frameworks were used.
The app is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers.

Future Improvements
Allow users to manually enter a skip interval.
Add a dark mode toggle.
Implement local storage to save results.
