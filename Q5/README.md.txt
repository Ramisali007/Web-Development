Roll-Number based Discount System

Overview
I implemented this project to create an e-commerce discount system where students can enter their roll number to get a dynamically generated discount on products. The discount percentage is determined by the middle two digits of the roll number, and the final price is calculated in real time.

Features
Roll-Number Discount: Extracts the middle two digits of the roll number to determine the discount percentage.
Product Selection: Displays a list of products with prices and allows students to add them to the cart.
Real-Time Updates: Calculates and shows the discounted price dynamically.
Multiple Discounts: Applies multiple discounts if more than one product is selected.
Promo Code: Allows students to enter an additional promo code for extra discounts after 2 purchases.

How to Use
1. Enter your roll number and an optional promo code.
2. Click "Apply Discount" to calculate the discount.
3. Add products to the cart by clicking "Add to Cart".
4. View the total discount and final price in the cart section.

Code Structure
HTML: index.html
CSS: styles.css
JavaScript: scripts.js

Constraints
No external libraries or frameworks were used.
The app is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers.

Future Improvements
Add user authentication for personalized discounts.
Implement a purchase history feature.
Add more advanced promo code logic.
