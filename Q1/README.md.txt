Interactive 3D Flip Product Card
Overview
I implemented this project to create a visually appealing 3D flip product card interface. The app allows users to view product details by hovering over the cards, which flip to reveal more information. It also includes a dark mode toggle for better user experience. The app is built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, with no external libraries or frameworks.
