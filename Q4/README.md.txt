Bank Account System

Overview
I implemented this project to simulate a bank account system where the account number and initial deposit are dynamically generated based on the studentâ€™s roll number. The system supports deposits, withdrawals, and transaction tracking while enforcing financial constraints.

Features
Account Creation: Generates a unique account number and initial deposit based on the roll number.
Deposits: Allows deposits that are multiples of the roll number.
Withdrawals: Limits withdrawals to 80% of the current balance.
Transaction History: Displays a dynamic list of all transactions.
Download History: Provides an option to download transaction history as a .txt file.

How to Use
1. Enter your roll number and click "Create Account".
2. Use the deposit and withdrawal buttons to perform transactions.
3. View your transaction history below.
4. Click "Download Transaction History" to save your transactions as a .txt file.

Code Structure
HTML: index.html
CSS: styles.css
JavaScript: scripts.js

Constraints
No external libraries or frameworks were used.
The app is fully responsive and works on all modern browsers.

Future Improvements
Add interest calculation for savings.
Implement user authentication for multiple accounts.
Add visual charts for transaction history.
